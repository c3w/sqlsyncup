This script requires a skeleton structure as follows
(pardon my ascii directory tree)
BACKUP_ROOT
          + [remote fully-qualified-host-name]
          |                                  + [sql database]
          |                                  + [sql database]
          |                                  + [sql database]
          + [additional hosts, like above    ]
           |                                  + [sql database]
           |                                  + [sql database]

 The upshot of this is that you only need to create a directory to add it
 to the backup list.
